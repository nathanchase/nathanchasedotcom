    <p>
      I'm a designer and developer with over 25 years of experience building for the web. Based in Central Florida, I've spent my career at the intersection of design and code — crafting interfaces, building products, and solving problems.

      I'm a co-founder and the designer of <a href="https://www.flickchart.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-amber hover:text-amber-light underline underline-offset-2">Flickchart</a>, a website built around a simple idea: helping people discover and define their favorite films through direct comparisons instead of star ratings. What started as a side project has grown into a passionate worldwide community of more than 250,000 users.

      Away from the screen, I've spent years behind a drum kit — touring with <a href="#music" class="text-amber hover:text-amber-light underline underline-offset-2">The Pauses</a>, Unsung Zeros, and Brownie Points, sharing stages with bands like Weezer, Metric, The Zombies, Silversun Pickups, and Jawbox. Above all, I'm a proud husband and father, a lifelong <a href="#watching" class="text-amber hover:text-amber-light underline underline-offset-2">movie obsessive</a>, a <a href="#gaming" class="text-amber hover:text-amber-light underline underline-offset-2">gamer</a> who is always looking for the next immersive experience, and someone who's always <a href="#listening" class="text-amber hover:text-amber-light underline underline-offset-2">listening</a> for the next great musical discovery.
